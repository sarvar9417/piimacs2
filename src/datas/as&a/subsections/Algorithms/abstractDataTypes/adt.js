            <b>An abstract data type</b> is a conceptual model that describes how data is
          organised and which operations can be carried out on the data (e.g.
          insert, delete) from the perspective of an end user who does not need
          to know how this is implemented. There are often many ways to
          implement an abstract data type, depending on the programming language
          being used.
